REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN : CIA_FACTSCRAPE


COMMAND LINE INTERFACE MECHANICS:

- Queries on the factbook will be performed using the following syntax:

[COUNTRY=<country name>] , [CONTINENT=<continent>] , ATTRIBUTE=<attribute> : VALUE=<keyword or digit> , [ (operator: <=, <, >, >=, ==) followed by (integer) ]

Brackets indicate optional parts of the query line. Every key/operator/value group will be separated by a comma.

This allows to search for a value under an attribute such as 'coastline' or 'diseases' and return a list of countries that match these specifications.


- A special predefined command can also be issued using the syntax:

DO=<special query name>

The rationale behind this is that we may want to introduce more "do this tricky query" commands in the future. After being given a name, they can be issued in the DO=<special query name> syntax.


MODULES & CLASSES

cia_factscrape.py --- this is the module that uses my factbook query library functions to expose a command line interface to the user. Handles the syntax described above. The interface to use the factbook query application is intentionally separated from the library of functions that do the actual work of querying the CIA factbook. This will allow various new (possibly GUI) interfaces to be written.

fact_query.py --- contains functions to perform various queries on the CIA factbook.
