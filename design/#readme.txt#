SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS TO RUN THE APPLICATION:
Python 2.6 : http://python.org/download/ : preferably use your package manager to install this
python-lxml : http://lxml.de/installation.html : preferably use your package manager to install this

TO RUN:
1 - go to src directory
2 - make sure main.py is still executable (run 'chmod a+x' if it isn't)
3 - run ./main.py. Assumes you have a python 2.6 interpreter installed (will probably work with 2.7 as well).

The design directory contains design documents and planning for the application.


APPROACH:

The language of choice for this project is Python because the project requirements allow me to greatly value speed of development over speed of execution.

The software engineering approach taken for this project is a hybrid between the waterfall model, where everything is planned out from the start before being coded, and the agile development model, where the software is incrementally revised and the general plan modified according to issues/realizations that come up.

Used the BeautifulSoup library to access DOM elements and look through factbook descriptions of various attributes. No need to reinvent the wheel...

Used Python's standard library urllib module to fetch data from factbook urls.


ASSIGNED QUERIES & RESULTS:

General Notes:
- fetching data from the urls is a performance bottleneck in this application.

1.     List countries in South America that are prone to earthquakes.






2.     List countries in Asia with more than 10 political parties.





3.     Find all countries that have the color blue in their flag.



4.     A landlocked country is one that is entirely enclosed by land. For example, Austria is landlocked and shares its borders with Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary, etc. There are certain countries that are entirely landlocked by a single country. Find these countries.





5.     I want to go on a vacation with a friend. Our goal is to visit as many capital cities as we can in as short a geographical distance as possible. To make things easier (and not worry about spherical geometry), we are fine with travelling to capitals that are within 10 degrees of latitude and longitude of each other. Find the lat/long coordinates and the list of countries/capitals so that the number of capitals is maximized.
